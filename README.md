# Machine_Learning_Projects

Hello Folks!!!

I am learning to be a successful Machine Learning Engineer. 
I am good with Python Language and its respective libraries such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow and Keras, Pandas, Numpy, and MatPlotlib.

In this repository, I have listed all the machine learning projects I have worked on, whether on Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

There are three projects so far - 
One on whether someone has heart disease or not based on their patient data. It's a simple binary classification problem.
Another is a regression problem predicting a bulldozer's current market prices based on its usage, model, etc.
Finally, using TensorFlow and Keras, I worked on a Dog Vision problem. Machine Learning model predicting the dog breed out of 120 breeds. It is an image multi-classification problem.

Feel free to look at my projects and get back to me, for anything be it to suggest, advise, or to just simply have a friendly chat. I am all game.

Cheers!!!
